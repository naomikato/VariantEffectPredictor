# Variant Effect Predictor

Welcome to the **Variant Effect Predictor** repository! This tool is designed to predict the functional effects of genetic variants using various annotation sources and algorithms. It can help researchers and bioinformaticians understand the potential impact of genetic variants on biological processes and disease.

## About

The Variant Effect Predictor uses a collection of annotation sources to provide insights into the potential consequences of genetic variants. It annotates variants with information such as gene names, protein domain overlaps, conservation scores, and more.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   
git clone https://github.com/naomikato/VariantEffectPredictor.git
cd VariantEffectPredictor


2. Install any required dependencies.

3. Run the Variant Effect Predictor:

python src/variant_effect_predictor.py -i data/input_variants.vcf -o data/output_annotations.txt


## Annotation Sources

The tool utilizes various annotation sources, including:

- dbSNP
- ClinVar
- ExAC
- PhyloP scores

These annotation sources contribute to understanding the functional implications of genetic variants.

## Example Data

The `data` directory contains example input and output files for testing the tool. The `input_variants.vcf` file contains sample variants, and the `output_annotations.txt` file demonstrates the annotated variants' functional effects.

## Contributions

Contributions to enhance the tool's functionality or add new annotation sources are welcome! Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for guidelines.
